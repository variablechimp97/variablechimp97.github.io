    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota fueled by a passion for technology and
      problem-solving. I'm always eager to learn and try new things â€“ both through coursework and self-driven projects.
      I'm drawn to technologies that make an impact, and my recent internship at Google working on a reporting framework
      solidified this. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, hiking, or hanging out with friends. Let's connect
      and talk tech!
