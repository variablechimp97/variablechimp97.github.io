        Google constantly pushes the boundaries of technology to make information accessible and usable in new ways.
        From leading search innovation to advancements in AI, cloud computing, and groundbreaking projects like
        self-driving cars, their impact is felt across industries. <br> I'm eager to keep exploring how I can contribute
        to their mission of solving complex problems.
      </p>
      <b>Role:</b>
      <p>This summer, I was a Google STEP Intern where I teamed up with another intern to build a Java backend from the
        ground up for an internal reporting demo. Our focus was making data easier to process and understand, improving
        how teams within Google could quickly get the insights they needed. I figured out the best way to structure the
        database so the API data was organized and easy for our app to use. I also wrote code to fine-tune how we
        fetched data, and added tests to make sure the app never showed inaccurate info to users. It was amazing to take
        the project from start to finish ‚Äì design documents, writing the actual code, fixing the inevitable bugs, the
        whole nine yards! This experience gave me a real taste of what it's like to build software within a big tech
        environment.

        Google strives to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
        <br>
        They find solutions to many complex problems, I'm excited to learn more about how I can be involved in any one
        of the many
        areas of technology they specialize in.
      </p>
      <b>Role:</b>
      <p>I'm a participant in their intensive 4-week Computer Science Summer Institue, meaning I have completed an
        introductory project-based HTML/CSS
        and JavaScript curriculum taught by Google engineers. I have built multiple projects and even have had the
        opportunity to present my final project
        to Google employees. Throughout the course, I have attended many workshops including product design, resume
        development, and a software engineering
        interview. Google CSSI has illustrated the importance of a collaborative, inclusive environment to problem-solve
        and use resources to succeed.

        CSE-IT supports current and future scientists and engineers while facilitating effective teaching, learning,
        research, and outreach.
        <br>
        In this department, they maintain servers, virtual/physical machines, and the network for the college.
      </p>
      <b>Role:</b>
      <p>
        I work on the Operations team to help take care of issues spanning from troubleshooting physical machines to
        deploying and configuring virtual machines
        for students to ssh into. This has been my first job in the tech industry and has introduced me to working on a
        team required to preserve the convenience of
        hardware, software, and network for students, professors, and staff of the University. This job has enabled me
        to learn proper development workflow, backend
        server management, and how to sustain a network to handle anything from students' laptops to robust file
        systems. Working on this team has truly
        been a wonderful introduction to what it means to supply quality Information Technology to users throughout an
        entire institution.

      <b>Role:</b>
      <p>
        I participated in their week-long externship filled with learning sessions, networking opportunities, and
        engagement activities.
        During this program, I learned about new technologies in security, AI, blockchain, and cloud data. I was able to
        learn how this company used these technologies
        to solve pressing business challenges. By attending this externship I have gained a better understanding of
        deconstructing problems and using our ever-developing
        technical solutions to deliver an effective solution.
