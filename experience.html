        Google strives to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
        <br>
        They find solutions to many complex problems, I'm excited to learn more about how I can be involved in any one of the many
        areas of technology they specialize in.

      <b>Role:</b>
      <p>I'm a participant in their intensive 4-week Computer Science Summer Institue, meaning I have completed an introductory project-based HTML/CSS
        and JavaScript curriculum taught by Google engineers. I have built multiple projects and even have had the opportunity to present my final project
        to Google employees. Throughout the course, I have attended many workshops including product design, resume development, and a software engineering
        interview. Google CSSI has illustrated the importance of a collaborative, inclusive environment to problem-solve and use resources to succeed.

      <b>Role:</b>
      <p>
        I work on the Operations team to help take care of issues spanning from troubleshooting physical machines to deploying and configuring virtual machines
        for students to ssh into. This has been my first job in the tech industry and has introduced me to working on a team required to preserve the convenience of
        hardware, software, and network for students, professors, and staff of the University. This job has enabled me to learn proper development workflow, backend
        server management, and how to sustain a network to handle anything from students' laptops to robust file systems. Working on this team has truly
        been a wonderful introduction to what it means to supply quality Information Technology to users throughout an entire institution.

      <b>Role:</b>
      <p>
        I participated in their week-long externship filled with learning sessions, networking opportunities, and engagement activities.
        During this program, I learned about new technologies in security, AI, blockchain, and cloud data. I was able to learn how this company used these technologies
        to solve pressing business challenges. By attending this externship I have gained a better understanding of deconstructing problems and using our ever-developing
        technical solutions to deliver an effective solution.
